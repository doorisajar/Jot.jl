# Jot


Pre-launch:
  - more useful terminal output

Future improvements
  - Interrogate the function for its argument type and therefore remove this as a required parameter
  - better errors:
    - aws cli check version
    - check that somebody is logged in
  - make other packagespecs (eg github, url) work
