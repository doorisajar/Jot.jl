Can we add the remote package as a dependency of Jot?
- that's not how things are currently done

Change dockerfile_add_target_package to more like dockerfile_add_responder with multiple dispatch?

runtests.jl, have test_responder etc only operate on a single responder, map it to all?

Have a testsuite object? Could be a LambdaComponents
